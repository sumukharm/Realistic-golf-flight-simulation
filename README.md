# Realistic-golf-flight-simulation

This project involved developing a golf flight simulator via interactive computer graphics. In a natural setting, the golf flight’s motion is dependent on velocity, angle of launch, air resistance, cross wind effects and many more parameters. These parameters were mathematically modelled to develop a trajectory drawing algorithm. The trajectories obtained clearly resembled the ’camera captured’ real trajectories. Theory for the object’s motion was utilized and then it was adapted for simulation which involved bouncing ball physics too.
