# Realistic-golf-flight-simulation

This project involves developing a golf flight simulator via interactive computer graphics. In a natural setting, the golf flight’s motion is dependent on velocity, angle of launch, air resistance, cross wind effects and many more parameters. These parameters are mathematically modelled to develop a trajectory drawing algorithm. The trajectories obtained clearly resemble the ’camera captured’ real trajectories. Theory for the object’s motion is utilized and then it is adapted for simulation which involves bouncing ball physics too.
